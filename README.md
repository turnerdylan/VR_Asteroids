# VR_Asteroids
 
Welcome to VR Asteroids! Our inspiration for this game was the old sci fi game Asteroids, in which you play as a spaceship who has to move to avoid asteroids and shoot them to destroy them. Our game is fairly similar, but features the player from a first person perspective on a platform with a laser gun, and as you play, asteroids fly at you, forcing you to either dodge them or destroy them with your gun.

As you play, a timer goes up and increments your time played, as does a score counter, which keeps track of the number of asteroids you have blown up. For the time being, the player is given three lives, and if you collide with an asteroid, you lose one. Its super fun, so go check out the game for yourself and see if you can beat our highscore!
